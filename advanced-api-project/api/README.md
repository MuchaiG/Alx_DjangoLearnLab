# ðŸ“˜ API Views Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of how each Django REST Framework (DRF) view is configured and intended to operate in the `advanced_api_project`. The project implements a simple `Book` API with full CRUD functionality, custom validation, filtering, and permission handling.

---

## Overview

The API exposes endpoints for managing `Book` resources. It includes the following operations:

- List all books  
- Retrieve a single book  
- Create a new book  
- Update an existing book  
- Delete a book  

Each view uses **DRF generic class-based views**, which provide built-in functionality for common operations, and has been customized for validation, permissions, and query handling.
